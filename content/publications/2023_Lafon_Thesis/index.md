abstract: "The purpose of this thesis is to study the near-wall rheology of liquids. In particular, we are interested in the molecular mechanisms underlying slip and liquid/solid friction. To this end, we probe the temperature effect on the dynamics of liquids near the solid. In a first part, we use molecular dynamics simulations of a glass-forming model liquid to study the temperature-dependence of friction. We show that, at high temperatures, both friction and slippage are activated processes, with an energy barrier that is controlled by the liquid/solid interaction energy. On the contrary, the supercooled liquid exhibits two different behaviours: for strong liquid/solid interactions, the friction, as the viscosity, diverges in a super-Arrhenian fashion. For weaker interactions, friction is strongly reduced as the first liquid layers in contact with the wall crystallise. In a second part, we focus on friction between polystyrene semi-dilute solutions and a solid wall. First, we use neutrons reflectivity to determine the near-surface concentration profile. In particular, we show that a polymer depletion at the interface does not prevent chain adsorption onto the substrate. Then, we develop a new method to measure liquid/solid friction using a rheometer. Surprisingly, we have observed a strong shear-rate dependency of the friction coefficient, which suggests that the interfacial liquid is shear-thinning, with a typical relaxation time that is different from the bulk one. Finally, we study the adsorption kinetics of polymer melts. We show that PDMS exhibits a particularly large adsorption rate compared to other polymers, and this is attributed to the strong interaction between PDMS and the surface."
