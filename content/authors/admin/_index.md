### About me ##

I am a physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces, working at
the LIPhy institute in Grenoble, France.

<span style="display: block; height: 8px;"></span>


### My current projects ##

I am currently part of two projects:

  - [chiral separation by chiral structures](https://suzannelafon.github.io/research/chiral_separation.html)
 
  - [dynamics of confined ionic liquids in a sheared polymer matrix](https://suzannelafon.github.io/research/confined_ions_dynamics.html)

### Call for data ##

I am currently developing an analysis to extract slip lengths and liquid/solid friction coefficients from shear rheology experiments, especially in the plate geometry.
If you have data from which you would like to extract this kind of parameters, feel free to contact me!
