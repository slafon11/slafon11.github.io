### About me ##

I am a physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces, working at
the LIPhy institute in Grenoble, France.

<span style="display: block; height: 8px;"></span>


### My current projects ##

I am currently part of two projects:

  - chiral separation by chiral structures: a Molecular Dynamics project to understand the mechanisms of chiral separation by a helicoidal (and thus chiral) molecule.
This is part of the CHIRAL CELL ANR project, in colloration with Benoit Coasne, Issei Otsuka and Yoshiharu Nishiyama.
 
  - dynamics of confined ionic liquids in a sheared polymer matrix: coupling rheology, electric conductivity and measurement of diffusion (quasi-elastic neutron scattering and NMR),
we study the role of shear in the dynamics of confined ionic liquids. This project is part of the SESAME ANR project, in collaboration with Hakima Mendil-Jakani and Marie Plazanet.
