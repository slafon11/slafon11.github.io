We explore the rheology of semi-dilute entangled polymer solutions in a good solvent as a function of temperature. In particular, we look at the link between the viscosity $\eta$ and the volume fraction $\phi$ of the polymer solution.

The viscosity is expected to obey to De Gennes' prediction:

$$
\eta(\phi) = \eta_{solvent} N^{3} \phi^{15/4}
$$

Using a plate rheometer, we measure the viscosity of PS/DEP (polystyrene/diethylphtalate) polymer solutions at various temperatures and volume fractions. We obtain a function $\eta(\phi) \propto \phi^{\alpha}$, and we plot $\alpha$ as a function of $T$.
