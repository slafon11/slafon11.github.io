We explore the rheology of semi-dilute entangled polymer solutions in a good solvent as a function of temperature. In particular, we look at the link between the viscosity $\eta$ and the volume fraction $\phi$ of the polymer solution.

The viscosity is expected to obey [De Gennes' prediction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ma60052a012):

$$
\eta(\phi) = \eta_{solvent} N^{3} \phi^{15/4}
$$

Using a plate rheometer, we measure the viscosity of PS/DEP (polystyrene/diethylphtalate) polymer solutions at various temperatures and volume fractions.
We obtain a function $\eta(\phi) \propto \phi^{\alpha}$, and we plot $\alpha$ as a function of $T$.
The above figure shows the exponent $\alpha$ as a function of the temperature $T$ and $T-T_{g}$ with $T_{g}$ the glass transition temperature of the solution.
In this figure, we gather results from various publications (solutions in t-decalin from [Kulicke *et al.*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01333878), 
in benzene from [Raspaud *et al.*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ma00108a020), in DEP from [Sanchez-Reyes *et al.*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/la0265326) for $T = 301$ K
and from us for the rest of the data).

It is observed that as the solution approaches its glass transition, the deviation of the exponent $\alpha$ increases.
