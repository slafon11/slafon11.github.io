To date, only a few techniques have been developed to experimentally investigate this type of interface at the nanometric scale of solid/liquid interactions. In this study, we probe the interface between a smooth sapphire surface and a semidilute polystyrene solution, using neutron reflectivity. A special setup for flow measurements under shear has been designed and optimized. Our results show that, at rest, polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid surface. Contrary to common assumptions, some polystyrene chains do adsorb onto the wall. Under flow conditions, we experimentally demonstrate that the depletion layer remains stable, a finding that has been hypothesized but is only vaguely confirmed in the literature.","tags":null,"title":"Near-Surface Concentration Profile of Sheared Semidilute Polymer Solutions","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Systems that interest me Soft matter systems, such as polymers and proteins Fluids in confined environments or near interfaces ","date":1735776e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735776e3,"objectID":"b8cbf49582fc476055c372b0995ed85b","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/systems.html","publishdate":"2025-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/systems.html","section":"gallery","summary":"Systems that interest me Soft matter systems, such as polymers and proteins Fluids in confined environments or near interfaces ","tags":null,"title":"","type":"gallery"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Preferred method Molecular simulations, particulalry when it can be compared to experiments like neutrons or NMR.\n","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"5dba78648dd0053d9a7bceb28321462d","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/methods.html","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/methods.html","section":"gallery","summary":"Preferred method Molecular simulations, particulalry when it can be compared to experiments like neutrons or NMR.\n","tags":null,"title":"","type":"gallery"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"57b622b25ca416079a4ea519d02d7b52","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2025_gravelle_acta_mechanica_effect_of_thermal.html","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2025_gravelle_acta_mechanica_effect_of_thermal.html","section":"publications","summary":"Graphene nanosheets display relatively large hydrodynamic slip lengths in most solvents and, because of this, adopt a stable orientation in a shear flow, instead of rotating, when the effect of thermal fluctuations is not too large (Kamal et al. in Nat Commun 11(1):2425, 2020). In this paper, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and continuum boundary integral simulations to demonstrate that the time-averaged ‘S’ shape adopted by a flexible graphene nanosheet subject to moderate thermal fluctuation is almost identical to the shape predicted for negligible thermal fluctuations. The stable ‘S’ shape adopted by the particle results primarily from the normal hydrodynamic traction, which is sensitive to the orientation of the particle with respect to the flow direction.

Minor solvents (such as water) are often introduced unintentionally or intentionally into SPEs. Although it can significantly affect SPEs’ electrochemical and mechanical properties, the fundamental role of such solvent content has rarely been studied. Here, we investigate the effects of minor water content on two representative SPEs through molecular dynamics simulations. Focusing on SPEs composed of different base polymers, namely, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and the same salt, lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), our simulations reveal that slight hydration facilitates an increase in ionic conductivity while preserving the mechanical integrity of the SPEs.

Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to stem from ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We rationalize our observations through molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a new state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport and electrified matter at interfaces.","tags":null,"title":"Giant mobility of surface-trapped ionic charges following liquid tribocharging","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Ángel Díaz Carral","**Simon Gravelle**","Maria Fyta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"ef934e43194b8d499ca97bafbdbef261","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2024_2_4_carral_apl_machine_learning_in_silico_design.html","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2024_2_4_carral_apl_machine_learning_in_silico_design.html","section":"publications","summary":"Quaternary phases formed in copper alloys are investigated through a combination of quantum-mechanical and classical computer simulations and active machine learning.

However, the role of temperature on slip close to the glass transition has been less explored. Here we use molecular dynamics to simulate a bidisperse atomic fluid, which can remain liquid below its melting point (supercooled state), to study the effect of temperature on friction and slip length between the liquid and a smooth apolar wall in a broad range of temperatures. At high temperatures, an Arrhenius law fits well the temperature dependence of viscosity, friction, and slip length. In contrast, when the fluid is supercooled, the viscosity becomes super-Arrhenian, while interfacial friction can remain Arrhenian or even drastically decrease when lowering the temperature, resulting in a massive increase of the slip length. We rationalize the observed superlubricity by the surface crystallization of the fluid, and the incommensurability between the structures of the fluid interfacial layer and of the wall. This study calls for experimental investigation of the slip length of supercooled liquids on low surface energy solids.","tags":null,"title":"Giant slip length at a supercooled liquid-solid interface","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Sabina Haber-Pohlmeier","Carlos Mattea","Siegfried Stapf","Christian Holm","Alexander Schlaich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"7f243f869b37895ff36425a6b9c3b835","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2023_39_22_gravelle_langmuir_nmr_investigation_of.html","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2023_39_22_gravelle_langmuir_nmr_investigation_of.html","section":"publications","summary":"The evaporation of water from bare soil is often accompanied by the formation of a layer of crystallized salt, a process that must be understood in order to address the issue of soil salinization.

Our experimental results display a stronger dispersion of the relaxation time T1 with frequency for the case of sodium sulfate as compared to sodium chloride salt crusts. To gain insight into these results, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of salt solutions confined within slit nanopores made of either NaCl or Na2SO4.
