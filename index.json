To date, only a few techniques have been developed to experimentally investigate this type of interface at the nanometric scale of solid/liquid interactions. In this study, we probe the interface between a smooth sapphire surface and a semidilute polystyrene solution, using neutron reflectivity. A special setup for flow measurements under shear has been designed and optimized. Our results show that, at rest, polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid surface. Contrary to common assumptions, some polystyrene chains do adsorb onto the wall. Under flow conditions, we experimentally demonstrate that the depletion layer remains stable, a finding that has been hypothesized but is only vaguely confirmed in the literature.","tags":null,"title":"Near-Surface Concentration Profile of Sheared Semidilute Polymer Solutions","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Systems that interest me Soft matter systems, such as polymers and proteins Fluids in confined environments or near interfaces ","date":1735776e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735776e3,"objectID":"b8cbf49582fc476055c372b0995ed85b","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/systems.html","publishdate":"2025-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/systems.html","section":"gallery","summary":"Systems that interest me Soft matter systems, such as polymers and proteins Fluids in confined environments or near interfaces ","tags":null,"title":"","type":"gallery"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Preferred method Molecular simulations, particulalry when it can be compared to experiments like neutrons or NMR.\n","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"5dba78648dd0053d9a7bceb28321462d","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/methods.html","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/methods.html","section":"gallery","summary":"Preferred method Molecular simulations, particulalry when it can be compared to experiments like neutrons or NMR.\n","tags":null,"title":"","type":"gallery"},{"authors":["**Suzanne Lafon**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1699574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699574400,"objectID":"2a52ad7beed3b0a783fe40ac489bc2e6","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2023_lafon_thesis.html","publishdate":"2023-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2023_lafon_thesis.html","section":"publications","summary":"The purpose of this thesis is to study the near-wall rheology of liquids. In particular, we are interested in the molecular mechanisms underlying slip and liquid/solid friction. To this end, we probe the temperature effect on the dynamics of liquids near the solid. In a first part, we use molecular dynamics simulations of a glass-forming model liquid to study the temperature-dependence of friction. We show that, at high temperatures, both friction and slippage are activated processes, with an energy barrier that is controlled by the liquid/solid interaction energy. On the contrary, the supercooled liquid exhibits two different behaviours: for strong liquid/solid interactions, the friction, as the viscosity, diverges in a super-Arrhenian fashion. For weaker interactions, friction is strongly reduced as the first liquid layers in contact with the wall crystallise. In a second part, we focus on friction between polystyrene semi-dilute solutions and a solid wall. First, we use neutrons reflectivity to determine the near-surface concentration profile. In particular, we show that a polymer depletion at the interface does not prevent chain adsorption onto the substrate. Then, we develop a new method to measure liquid/solid friction using a rheometer. Surprisingly, we have observed a strong shear-rate dependency of the friction coefficient, which suggests that the interfacial liquid is shear-thinning, with a typical relaxation time that is different from the bulk one. Finally, we study the adsorption kinetics of polymer melts. We show that PDMS exhibits a particularly large adsorption rate compared to other polymers, and this is attributed to the strong interaction between PDMS and the surface.","tags":null,"title":"Liquid/solid interfacial rheology: from numerical simulations to experiments","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Suzanne Lafon**","Alexis Chennevière","Frédéric Restagno","Sami Merabia","Laurent Joly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675641600,"objectID":"7fec0309257d267d0b501031532ba118","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2023_107_2_pre.html","publishdate":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2023_107_2_pre.html","section":"publications","summary":"The effect of temperature on friction and slip at the liquid-solid interface has attracted attention over the last 20 years, both numerically and experimentally. However, the role of temperature on slip close to the glass transition has been less explored. Here we use molecular dynamics to simulate a bidisperse atomic fluid, which can remain liquid below its melting point (supercooled state), to study the effect of temperature on friction and slip length between the liquid and a smooth apolar wall in a broad range of temperatures. At high temperatures, an Arrhenius law fits well the temperature dependence of viscosity, friction, and slip length. In contrast, when the fluid is supercooled, the viscosity becomes super-Arrhenian, while interfacial friction can remain Arrhenian or even drastically decrease when lowering the temperature, resulting in a massive increase of the slip length. We rationalize the observed superlubricity by the surface crystallization of the fluid, and the incommensurability between the structures of the fluid interfacial layer and of the wall. This study calls for experimental investigation of the slip length of supercooled liquids on low surface energy solids.","tags":null,"title":"Giant slip length at a supercooled liquid-solid interface","type":"publications"}]
