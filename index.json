A special setup for flow measurements under shear has been designed and optimized. Our results show that, at rest, polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid surface. Contrary to common assumptions, some polystyrene chains do adsorb onto the wall.

While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol.

This phenomenon, resulting from the balance between solid-liquid and liquid-liquid interactions, could benefit the development of microporous membranes for separating water-alcohol mixtures. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations of water-ethanol mixtures near planar organosilica surfaces, focussing on the role of surface properties in interfacial ethanol enrichment. Organosilica surfaces were chosen for their tunable hydrophobicity, achieved by varying the ratio of methyl to hydroxyl groups. Our findings reveal significant ethanol enrichment at hydrophobic organosilica surfaces decorated with methyl groups, similar to previous observations with graphite. We analyze ethanol enrichment in relation to mixture composition and surface properties, such as roughness and the spatial organization of surface groups. By demonstrating the ability of organosilica materials to preferentially adsorb ethanol over water, this work identifies a cost-effective alternative to carbon-based materials for the fabrication of filtration membranes.","tags":null,"title":"Adsorption Selectivity of Water-Ethanol Mixtures on Organosilica Surfaces: Role of Hydrophilicity","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"57b622b25ca416079a4ea519d02d7b52","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2025_gravelle_acta_mechanica_effect_of_thermal.html","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2025_gravelle_acta_mechanica_effect_of_thermal.html","section":"publications","summary":"Graphene nanosheets display relatively large hydrodynamic slip lengths in most solvents and, because of this, adopt a stable orientation in a shear flow, instead of rotating, when the effect of thermal fluctuations is not too large (Kamal et al. in Nat Commun 11(1):2425, 2020). In this paper, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and continuum boundary integral simulations to demonstrate that the time-averaged ‘S’ shape adopted by a flexible graphene nanosheet subject to moderate thermal fluctuation is almost identical to the shape predicted for negligible thermal fluctuations. The stable ‘S’ shape adopted by the particle results primarily from the normal hydrodynamic traction, which is sensitive to the orientation of the particle with respect to the flow direction.

Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We rationalize our observations through molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface.

Here we use molecular dynamics to simulate a bidisperse atomic fluid, which can remain liquid below its melting point (supercooled state), to study the effect of temperature on friction and slip length between the liquid and a smooth apolar wall in a broad range of temperatures. At high temperatures, an Arrhenius law fits well the temperature dependence of viscosity, friction, and slip length. In contrast, when the fluid is supercooled, the viscosity becomes super-Arrhenian, while interfacial friction can remain Arrhenian or even drastically decrease when lowering the temperature, resulting in a massive increase of the slip length. We rationalize the observed superlubricity by the surface crystallization of the fluid, and the incommensurability between the structures of the fluid interfacial layer and of the wall.

The contribution of cell division to development is particularly striking in plants because plant cells are surrounded by stiff walls, making them clearly distinguishable from each other and fixing their spatial relation by preventing cell migration. As a result, many of the first microscopic observations ever published are of regularly organized cells within plant tissues.
